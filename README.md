 # Challenge
 THERE ARE _3_ TASKS TO DO IN THIS CODE
 
 * Task ONE: Make it so every vowel in the string is replaced by a lowercase x
 
 * Task TWO: Make it so when a string ends in a consonant the string is finished with ", right?"
 
 * Task THREE: Make it so each string starts with the number of characters in the string in parenthesis, so for example:
 
 ```(18) this is my example```

 `18` because `this is my example` has 18 characters
 


# GOAL
 * Make it so the feature flags can be turned on and off, independently, and that the behaviour is still respected for each task.
 * Ideally the complexity of the code should NOT increase exponentially.
