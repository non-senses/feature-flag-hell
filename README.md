 # Challenge
 THERE ARE _3_ TASKS TO DO IN THIS CODE
 
 * Task ONE: Make it so every vowel in the string is replaced by a lowercase x
 
 * Task TWO: Make it so when a string ends in a consonant the string is finished with ", right?"
 
 * Task THREE: Make it so each string starts with the number of characters in the string in parenthesis, so for example:
 
 ```(18) this is my example```

 `18` because `this is my example` has 18 characters
 


# GOAL
 * Make it so the feature flags can be turned on and off, independently, and that the behaviour is still respected for each task.
 * Ideally the complexity of the code should NOT increase exponentially.

# Hint
Since I'm a bit restless, I decided to do task One so you only need to focus on the other two tasks. I've followed the recommendations I've seen around the office, which are the guidelines we give to developers.
